# Lending club case study 


## Object of data analysis
- The main cause of financial loss is lending money to borrowers who are deemed to be "risky."
- (referred to as credit loss). The amount of money lost by the lender when a borrower defaults on a loan or flees with the money owed is known as the credit loss. 
- The primary aim is to detect these high-risk loan candidates so that the number of these loans may be lowered and the amount of credit loss can be minimized. 
The objective of this case study is to identify such applications using EDA. 
- Conduct a study to determine the variables that are strong indicators of default—that is, the driving factors, or driver variables—behind loan default.  
This information can be used by the business for risk assessment and portfolio management.
